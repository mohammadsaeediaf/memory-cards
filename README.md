# How the Game Works 🎮
1. The game consists of a set of cards placed face down on the game board.

2. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time.

3. If the two cards match, they stay face-up.

4. If they don’t match, they are flipped back over after a short delay.

5. The goal is to match all pairs of cards before time runs out or within a set number of turns.
