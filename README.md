Designed with React for smooth and dynamic user experience.

Simple and clean UI with flip animations for cards.

How the Game Works
The game consists of a set of cards placed face down on the game board.

Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time.

If the two cards match, they stay face-up.

If they donâ€™t match, they are flipped back over after a short delay.

The goal is to match all pairs of cards before time runs out or within a set number of turns.
